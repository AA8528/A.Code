    <strong>Wings</strong>

    <p>
        Wings is the second Korean studio album (fourth overall) by South Korean boy band BTS.<br>
        The album was released on October 10, 2016, by Big Hit Entertainment.<br>
        It is available in four versions and contains fifteen tracks, with "Blood Sweat & Tears" serving as its lead single.<br>
        Heavily influenced by Hermann Hesse's coming of age novel, Demian, the concept album thematically deals with temptation and growth.<br>
        It was later reissued as a repackage album, titled You Never Walk Alone, on February 13, 2017, a continuation of the canon for Wings.<br>
        Three new songs were added to the track listing, with "Spring Day" and "Not Today" promoted as the lead singles.<br>
